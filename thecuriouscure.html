<p>On an ordinary day, Schofield and his team were working in their labs on producing more medicines for the pharmacies. Break time had come so they all gathered to eat and watch some news. Jay, Schofield’s lab mate turned the television on and here was where they heard the shocking news, a new disease had spread all around their city and no cure had been discovered yet.</p>
<p>“Oh lord,” Jay said.<br>
“I think this is enough break time, let’s head back to work,” Schofield said<br>
“But I’m still hungry,” Ali pouted.<br>
“We can eat later Ali,” said Cole.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong></p>
<p>On the next day’s night. Schofield’s team was exhausted from working on finding a new cure for the disease all day and they decided to go for dinner outside.<br>
“Who’s down for a chill outdoor dinner?” Ali said.<br>
“I’m coming,” Cole said.<br>
“I’m hella hungry as well, count me with you,” Jay said.<br>
“What about you Schofield?” Ali said.<br>
“I think I will stay here and work on the cure,” Schofield said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Alright then, I will wait for you guys in the car,” Ali said.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali, Jay, and Cole stayed outdoors the whole night while Schofield stayed up trying to find a cure. While he was working, a rat escaped its cage and ran out to the backyard, so he decided to run after the rat to bring it back to its cage. Schofield went outside there he found a bizarre-looking device lying on the backyard’s grass, he couldn’t recognize it and he grabbed the device, it had a big red button, he clicked it and in a flash, a vortex formed, it had a very powerful gravity just like a black hole. It swallowed him suddenly and threw him in a different dimension.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong></p>
<p>Schofield was so impressed because the dimension was very beautiful where there were giant colourful trees and there was a lake, the water was so pure that he can see the bottom of it. Schofield found an old man who looked like waiting for him.<br>
“Welcome to The Ethereal Isles,” said the old man<br>
“Thanks... what is this place though?” Schofield replied.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In this land, you will find the cure you are looking for,” said the old man.<br>
“No wonder how I would get a cure from a majestic dimension like this one. Where can I find it?” Schofield replied.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The cure is held by the Crunchy Blunchy rabbits in the Leap Castle.” said the old man.<br>
“And who are these… clanchy franchy rabbits?” Schofield said, his eyes widening<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They are a dangerous group of evil rabbits, and they hold the Leap Castle.” said the old man.<br>
“Sounds funny, can we head there?” asked Schofield.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes we will right now,” said the old man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man whistled and out of nowhere, a giant rat appeared with a saddle on it, they both mounted the giant rat and it started to fly to the Leap Castle.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong></p>
<p>The sky was gorgeous on the way to the castle. The clouds were like a painting, they were shaped in different shapes, and there was gradual colouring in the sky, it looked as good as heaven would be.<br>
“Soo… what is your name?” Schofield asked wonderingly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My name is Morgan Zhang.” the old man replied.<br>
“Oh, nice to meet you,” Schofield said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgan didn’t answer. When they arrived at the castle it looked creepy, not like the rest of the dimension, the sky was dark and there were a lot of bats roaming around it.<br>
“What the… are we getting inside this castle?” Schofield asked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am afraid the answer is yes if you want to find the cure,” Morgan answered.<br>
Schofield got forward to enter the castle when Morgan refused to enter with him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you not coming,” Schofield asked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Unfortunately, I can’t risk getting inside the castle, I will be waiting for you out here,” Morgan answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schofield entered the castle alone, it was huge and it had giant doors on every side. Schofield didn’t enter any doors, instead, he walked all the way to the end of the path. He was surprised when he found Ali standing there trying to solve a puzzle to pass to the other side of the path.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ali?! What got you in here?” Schofield exclaimed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Schofield! Long story, I will tell you later... right now help me solve this puzzle!” Ali explained.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Alright alright,”</p>
<p><strong>6</strong></p>
<p>The puzzle was 4 doors, every door had a different shape image on it, the first door had a circle, the second door had a triangle, the third had a square, and the fourth had a hexagon. There was a sign beside the four doors and it said “behind three of the four doors a crowd of angry skeletons that will kill you, only one will lead you to the Room of Leaping, choose wisely” and the last two words were written in bloody colour. Next to this sign there was another sign and it was bigger than the first one, and it said, “Door number 5 is the solution.”. Ali and Schofield were so confused because there was no fifth door there. They tried to look around the place to find any hint that would lead them to the right answer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Should we just shoot a shot?” Ali asked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, absolutely not, we will die if we do,” Schofield answered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Then what are we supposed to do now?” Ali said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Just give me a minute, let me think, Ali!” Schofield replied.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, an idea flashed in Schofield’s mind, every shape had a different number of sides, the triangle had 3, the square had 4, the circle was infinite and the hexagon had 5, so he thought it would be the hexagon. Schofield told Ali about the idea and it made sense for both of them so they decided to open the door with a hexagon on it. And it appears that it was the right door. Ali and Schofield were so happy when they figured that out.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kept walking and walking in the path that would lead them to the Room of Leaping, and eventually, they arrived there to see what Morgan Zhang warned them about: the Crunchy Blunchy Rabbits who held the whole castle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were about 15 rabbits with red eyes, they were almost cow-sized and there was one bigger rabbit, it wore golden clothes and a crown. It was sitting on a throne and it held a carrot-like staff in its hand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You have finally arrived, we have been waiting for you.” Said the biggest rabbit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We came for the cure, where is it?” Schofield said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In order to claim the cure, you will have to defeat us. The Crunchy Blunchy Rabbits.” said the biggest rabbit.<br>
Before they started the fight, Ali gave Schofield a fancy weapon and jump-boost boots and told him to use them. Schofield stared at Ali and they nodded at each other. After that, they advanced and the fight began.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was brutal because both sides had powerful weapons and equipment. The rabbits were able to jump so high, so did Schofield and Ali because of some of the equipment Ali had. They started shooting at each other and the bullets looked like stamina suction power. Ali and Schofield managed to take down 13 of the 15 rabbits. While Ali was battling with the 14th rabbit, he got knocked down.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ali! No- no no hold on- please you will be fine” Schofield said in a panicking moment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Schofield- leave me here and kill these devils. “ Ali replied with a weak voice.<br>
After that, Ali lay down and closed his eyes - he was dead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Noooo! Ali!!” Schofield screamed in anger.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment of rage, Schofield took down the 14th rabbit brutally. Only the big rabbit was left alone, he looked around and saw all his guards had been knocked out, so he escaped with a jetpack through a hole that had opened in the roof. Schofield was left alone in the Room of Leaping in a weird silence. Suddenly, from the floor, the cure appeared and was ready to be claimed. Schofield was happy when he saw the cure and he advanced in a rush to grab it, but here was where a very shocking moment happened.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the blue and all of a sudden, everything disappeared and became black and this is when Schofield opened his eyes and found Cole waking him up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Schofield, SCHOFIELD open your eyes, are you okay? It looks like you fell asleep while working on the cure.” Cole said in a joyful voice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ali! Ali died- when we were fighting the rabbits!!” Schofield said in anger.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What the hell are you saying? Ali is in the kitchen eating, you gotta hurry because he will not leave any chicken for you,” Cole said. “Oh also! How can I forget, they found a cure for the disease, cheer up, my guy!”<br>
As Schofield slowly walked towards the kitchen he realized that everything he had seen - and everything he had done - had been in a fit of exhaustion-induced hallucinations while he worked on finding the cure.</p>
