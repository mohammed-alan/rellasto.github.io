<p>What a beautiful night it is. The stars shine brightly, displaying their various shapes across the sky. The city glows with its lit buildings, their towering presence piercing through the clouds. The wind rushes through me, incredibly refreshing. This night fuels my motivation to achieve, to succeed, and to thrive. Gazing through the windows of the buildings, I witness an artist drawing, a skill I aspire to master as a painter. Echoes of piano melodies reach my ears from a distance, a tune I aim to learn.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong></p>
<p>Amidst the enjoyment of this night, I also glimpse its darker aspects. I see the homeless sifting through garbage, prompting my commitment to donate and aid every homeless individual in my city—just wait and watch me. Ambulances speed in various directions, igniting my determination to become a doctor, a surgeon who contributes significantly to healthcare—I promise this city and the world.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong></p>
<p>Despite the wind turning a bit rough, almost feeling like a slap on my face, I refuse to let it ruin this beautiful night. As the vision becomes clearer, more of the cityscape unfolds before me. I witness a heartbroken man screaming alone in a field—I empathize, vowing to rehabilitate young men like him, making them better individuals—you just trust me on this. I see talented kids playing soccer with a deflated ball—I pledge to highlight and nurture these hidden talents, making them shine—just sit and watch me.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong></p>
<p>As I draw nearer, the vision becomes more vivid. I revisit the time when my best friend and I first met—a moment as beautiful as this night. I reminisce about swinging together with my mom in the park, promising her that I'll make a significant impact on the world when I grow up. Though I tried, sometimes life's winds blow against our ship's wishes.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong></p>
<p>As I approach closer, almost fading away, a sudden feeling of laughter embraces me. I experience the mixed emotions of happiness and sadness as I depart. It was challenging while it lasted, but I aimed to make the best of it. I revel in happiness, imagining the future kid who will stand up and confidently declare, "just sit and watch me, I will make the best of it." Ah, this night was so beautiful that it feels like I aged with it, as if I missed nothing. It allowed me to imagine and live the experiences I dreamed of. Perhaps I can rest assured that someday, one child will rise and become who I am. Maybe, for once, I can sit down and watch the best of it being made.</p>
